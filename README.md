Game networking is a subset of computer networking that specifically covers data replication, state synchronization and RPCs for multiplayer online games. Entity interpolation, input prediction, lag compensation and client-server model topics are main pillars of gameplay network development. This list contains handfully picked resources ranging between high-level network architectures and low-level data replication optimizations.
