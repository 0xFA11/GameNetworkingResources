[![Game Networking Resources](BANNER.png)](#readme)

**Game Networking** (aka _multiplayer networking_ or _netcode_) is the synchronization of game state and events between multiple players connected over the network. It focuses on the inherent challenges of multiplayer online games such as latency, jitter and packet loss, mitigating through sophisticated algorithms and techniques, including prediction, compensation, reconciliation, interpolation and other mechanisms. It is also often deeply involved and integrated with other game systems such as physics, animation and gameplay.
